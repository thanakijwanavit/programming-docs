## What is AWS SAM?

AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications using infrastructure as code (IaC). With AWS SAM's shorthand syntax, developers declare AWS CloudFormation resources and specialized serverless resources that are transformed to infrastructure during deployment. This framework includes two main components: the AWS SAM CLI and the AWS SAM project. The AWS SAM project is the application project directory that is created when you run `sam init`. The AWS SAM project includes files like the AWS SAM template, which includes the template specification (the shorthand syntax you use to declare resources).

### Key features

AWS SAM offers a variety of benefits that improve the developer experience by allowing you to:

- Define your application infrastructure code quickly, using less code
- Author AWS SAM templates to define your serverless application infrastructure code. Deploy your templates directly to AWS CloudFormation to provision your resources.
- Manage your serverless applications through their entire development lifecycle
- Use the AWS SAM CLI to manage your serverless application through the authoring, building, deploying, testing, and monitoring phases of your development lifecycle. For more information, see [The AWS SAM CLI](#the-aws-sam-cli).
- Quickly provision permissions between resources with AWS SAM connectors
- Use AWS SAM connectors in your AWS SAM templates to define permissions between your AWS resources. AWS SAM transforms your code into the IAM permissions required to facilitate your intent. For more information, see [Managing resource permissions with AWS SAM connectors](#managing-resource-permissions-with-aws-sam-connectors).
- Continuously sync local changes to the cloud as you develop
- Use the AWS SAM CLI `sam sync` command to automatically sync local changes to the cloud, speeding up your development and cloud testing workflows. For more information, see [Introduction to using sam sync to sync to AWS Cloud](#intro-to-sam-sync).
- Manage your Terraform serverless applications
- Use the AWS SAM CLI to perform local debugging and testing of your Lambda functions and layers. For more information, see [AWS SAM CLI Terraform support](#aws-sam-cli-terraform-support).

- For an overview on how you can use AWS SAM to create a serverless application, see [How to use AWS SAM](#how-to-use-aws-sam).

## How it works

AWS SAM consists of two primary components you use to create your serverless application:

1. **The AWS SAM project** - The folders and files that are created when you run the `sam init` command. This directory includes the AWS SAM template, an important file that defines your AWS resources. This template includes the AWS SAM template specification - the open-source framework that comes with a simplified shorthand syntax you use to define the functions, events, APIs, configurations, and permissions of your serverless application.
2. **The AWS SAM CLI** - A command line tool that you can use with your AWS SAM project and supported third-party integrations to build and run your serverless applications. The AWS SAM CLI is the tool you use to run commands on your AWS SAM project and eventually turn it into your serverless application.

To express resources, event source mappings, and other properties that define your serverless application, you define resources and develop your application in the AWS SAM template and other files in your AWS SAM project. You use the AWS SAM CLI to run commands on your AWS SAM project, which is how you initialize, build, test, and deploy your serverless application.

> We recommend you review [Serverless concepts for AWS Serverless Application Model](#serverless-concepts).

## What is the AWS SAM template specification?

The AWS SAM template specification is an open-source framework that you can use to define and manage your serverless application infrastructure code. The AWS SAM template specification is:

- **Built on AWS CloudFormation** - You use the AWS CloudFormation syntax directly in your AWS SAM template, taking advantage of its extensive support of resource and property configurations. If you are already familiar with AWS CloudFormation, you don't have to learn a new service to manage your application infrastructure code.
- **An extension of AWS CloudFormation** - AWS SAM offers its own unique syntax that focuses specifically on speeding up serverless development. You can use both the AWS CloudFormation and AWS SAM syntax within the same template.
- **An abstract, shorthand syntax** - Using the AWS SAM syntax, you can define your infrastructure quickly, in fewer lines of code, and with a lower chance of errors. Its syntax is especially curated to abstract away the complexity in defining your serverless application infrastructure.
- **Transformational** - AWS SAM does the complex work of transforming your template into the code necessary to provision your infrastructure through AWS CloudFormation.

## What is the AWS SAM project and AWS SAM template?

The AWS SAM project includes the AWS SAM template which contains the AWS SAM template specification. This specification is the open-source framework that you use to define your serverless application infrastructure on AWS, with some additional components that make them easier to work with. In this sense, AWS SAM templates are an extension of AWS CloudFormation templates.

Here's an example of a basic serverless application. This application processes requests to get all items from a database through an HTTP request. It consists of the following parts:

1. A function that contains the logic to process the request.
2. An HTTP API to serve as communication between the client (requestor) and the application.
3. A database to store items.
4. Permissions for the application to run securely.

This application's infrastructure code can be defined in the following AWS SAM template:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Resources:
  getAllitemsFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      Handler: src/get-all-items.getAllitemsHandler
      Runtime: nodejs20.x
    Events:
      Api:
        Type: HttpApi
        Properties:
          Path: /
          Method: GET
    Connectors:
      MyConn:
        Properties:
          Destination:
            Id: SampleTable
          Permissions:
            - Read
          SampleTable:
            Type: AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable
```

In 23 lines of code, the following infrastructure is defined:

- A function using the AWS Lambda service.
- An HTTP API using the Amazon API Gateway service.
- A database using the Amazon DynamoDB service.
- The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions necessary for these services to interact with one another.

To provision this infrastructure, the template is deployed to AWS CloudFormation. During deployment, AWS SAM transforms the 23 lines of code into the AWS CloudFormation syntax required to generate these resources in AWS. The transformed AWS CloudFormation template contains over 200 lines of code!

By using AWS SAM, you define 23 lines of infrastructure code. AWS SAM transforms your code into the 200+ lines of AWS CloudFormation code necessary to provision your application.

## What is the AWS SAM CLI?

The AWS SAM CLI is a command line tool that you can use with AWS SAM templates and supported third-party integrations to build and run your serverless applications. Use the AWS SAM CLI to:

- Quickly initialize a new application project.
- Build your application for deployment.
- Perform local debugging and testing.
- Deploy your application.
- Configure CI/CD deployment pipelines.
- Monitor and troubleshoot your application in the cloud.
- Sync local changes to the cloud as you develop.
- And more!

The AWS SAM CLI is best utilized when used with AWS SAM and AWS CloudFormation templates. It also works with third-party products such as Terraform.

### Initialize a new project

Select from starter templates or choose a custom template location to begin a new project.

Here, we use the `sam init` command to initialize a new application project. We select the Hello World Example project to start with. The AWS SAM CLI downloads a starter template and creates our project folder directory structure.

```bash
$ sam init
You can preselect a particular runtime or package type when using the 'sam init' experience. Call 'sam init --help' to learn more.

Which template source would you like to use?
1 - AWS Quick Start Templates
2 - Custom Template Location

Choice: 1

8 - Serverless Connector Hello World Example
9 - Multi-step workflow with Connectors
10 - Lambda EFS example
11 - Machine Learning

Template: 1
Use the most popular runtime and package type? (Python and zip) [y/N]: y
```

For more details, see [Create your application](#create-your-application) in AWS SAM.

### Build your application for deployment

Package your function dependencies and organize your project code and folder structure to prepare for deployment.

Here, we use the `sam build` command to prepare our application for deployment. The AWS SAM CLI creates a `.aws-sam` directory and organizes our application dependencies and files there for deployment.

```bash
$ sam build
Building codeuri: /path/to/your/code runtime: python3.8 metadata: {} functions: ['HelloWorldFunction']
Running PythonPipBuilder:ResolveDependencies
Running PythonPipBuilder:CopySource
```

For more details, see [Build your application](#build-your-application).

### Test and debug your application

Use the AWS SAM CLI to test and debug your serverless application locally before deploying to the AWS Cloud.

Here, we use the `sam local invoke` command to test our Lambda function locally.

```bash
$ sam local invoke HelloWorldFunction
Invoking app.lambda_handler (python3.9)
Local image was not found.

```

For more details, see [Test your application](#test-your-application) and [Debug your application](#debug-your-application).

### Deploy your application

Configure your application's deployment settings and deploy to the AWS Cloud to provision your resources.

Here, we use the `sam deploy --guided` command to deploy our application through an interactive flow. The AWS SAM CLI guides us through configuring our application's deployment settings, transforms our template into AWS CloudFormation, and deploys to AWS CloudFormation to create our resources.

```bash
$ sam deploy --guided

```

For more details, see [Deploy your application and resources](#deploy-your-application-and-resources).

### Configure CI/CD deployment pipelines

Create secure continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, using a supported CI/CD system.

Here, we use the `sam pipeline init --bootstrap` command to configure a CI/CD deployment pipeline for our application. The AWS SAM CLI guides us through our options and generates the AWS resources and configuration file to use with our CI/CD system.

```bash
$ sam pipeline init --bootstrap
[3] Reference application build resources
Enter the pipeline execution role ARN if you have previously created one, or we will create one for you []:

For more details, see [Deploy with CI/CD systems and pipelines](#deploy-with-cicd-systems-and-pipelines).

### Monitor and troubleshoot your application in the cloud

View important information about your deployed resources, gather logs, and utilize built-in monitoring tools such as AWS X-Ray.

Here, we use the `sam list` command to view our deployed resources. We get our API endpoint and invoke it, which triggers our function. Then, we use `sam logs` to view our function's logs.

```bash
$ sam list

For more details, see [Monitor your application](#monitor-your-application).

### Sync local changes to the cloud as you develop

As you develop on your local machine, automatically sync changes to the cloud. Quickly see your changes and perform testing and validation in the cloud.

Here, we use the `sam sync --watch` command to have the AWS SAM CLI watch for local changes. We modify our `HelloWorldFunction` code and the AWS SAM CLI automatically detects the change and deploys our updates to the cloud.

```bash
$ sam sync --watch
stack update succeeded. Sync infra completed.
infra sync completed.
CodeTrigger not created as CodeUri or DefinitionUri is missing for ServerlessRestApi.

Finished syncing Lambda Function HelloWorldFunction.
```

### Test supported resources in the cloud

Invoke and pass events to supported resources in the cloud.

Here, we use the `sam remote invoke` command to test a deployed Lambda function in the cloud. We invoke our Lambda function and receive its logs and response. With our Lambda function configured to stream responses, the AWS SAM CLI streams its response back in real time.

```bash
$ sam remote invoke StreamingFunction --stack-name lambda-streaming-app
```

For more details, see [Test with sam remote invoke](#test-with-sam-remote-invoke).

## Next steps

If this is your first time using AWS SAM, see [Getting started with AWS SAM](#getting-started).

## Serverless concepts

Learn about basic serverless concepts before using the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM).

### Event-driven architecture

A serverless application consists of individual AWS services, such as AWS Lambda for compute and Amazon DynamoDB for database management, that each perform a specialized role. These services are then loosely integrated with each other through an event-driven architecture. To learn more about event-driven architecture, see [What is an Event-Driven Architecture?](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/event-driven-architecture/).

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a way of treating infrastructure in the same way that developers treat code, applying the same rigor of application code development to infrastructure provisioning. You define your infrastructure in a template file, deploy it to AWS, and AWS creates the resources for you. With IaC, you define in code what you want AWS to provision. For more information, see [Infrastructure as Code](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/resources/infrastructure-as-code/) in the Introduction to DevOps on AWS Whitepaper.

### Serverless technologies

With AWS serverless technologies, you can build and run applications without having to manage your own servers. All server management is done by AWS, providing many benefits such as automatic scaling and built-in high availability, letting you take your idea to production quickly. Using serverless technologies, you can focus on the core of your product without having to worry about managing and operating servers. To learn more about serverless, see the following:

- [Serverless on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/)
- [Serverless Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless/latest/devguide/) - Provides a conceptual overview of serverless development in the AWS Cloud.

For a basic introduction to the core AWS serverless services, see [Serverless 101: Understanding the serverless services](https://serverlessland.com/learn/serverless-101) at Serverless Land.

### Serverless Application

When you use AWS SAM, you manage related resources in an application, which consists of your AWS SAM project and template. All the resources in your application are defined or referred to in your AWS SAM template. When AWS SAM processes your template, it creates AWS CloudFormation resources. In AWS CloudFormation, resources are managed in a single unit called a stack, and all the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's AWS CloudFormation template.

## Getting started

Get started with AWS SAM by reviewing and completing the topics in this section. [AWS SAM prerequisites](#prerequisites) provides detailed instructions on setting up an AWS account, creating IAM users, creating key access, and installing and configuring the AWS SAM CLI. After completing the prerequisites, you'll be ready to [Install the AWS SAM CLI](#install-the-aws-sam-cli), which you can do on Linux, Windows, and macOS operating systems. After installation is complete, you can optionally walk through the [AWS SAM Hello World tutorial](#hello-world-tutorial). Following this tutorial will walk you through the process of creating a basic serverless application with AWS SAM. After completing the tutorial, you'll be ready to review the concepts detailed in [How to use AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)](#how-to-use-aws-sam).

### Prerequisites

Complete the following prerequisites before installing and using the AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (AWS SAM CLI).

To use the AWS SAM CLI, you need the following:

- An AWS account, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials, and an IAM access key pair.
- The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to configure AWS credentials.

#### Step 1: Sign up for an AWS account

If you do not have an AWS account, complete the following steps to create one.

To sign up for an AWS account:

1. Open [https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).
2. Follow the online instructions.

   Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad.

   When you sign up for an AWS account, an AWS account root user is created. The root user has access to all AWS services and resources in the account. As a security best practice, assign administrative access to a user, and use only the root user to perform tasks that require root user access.

#### Step 2: Create an IAM user account

To create an administrator user, choose one of the following options:

| Choose one way to manage your administrator | To | By | You can also |
|---------------------------------------------|----|----|--------------|
| **In IAM Identity Center (Recommended)**    | Use short-term credentials to access AWS. This aligns with the security best practices. For information about best practices, see [Security best practices in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) in the IAM User Guide. | Following the instructions in [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) in the AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide. | Configure programmatic access by [Configuring the AWS CLI to use AWS IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/sso-configure-profile-token.html) in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. |
| **In IAM (Not recommended)**                | Use long-term credentials to access AWS. | Following the instructions in [Create an IAM user for emergency access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) in the IAM User Guide. | Configure programmatic access by [Manage access keys for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) in the IAM User Guide. |

#### Step 3: Create an access key ID and secret access key

For CLI access, you need an access key ID and a secret access key. Use temporary credentials instead of long-term access keys when possible. Temporary credentials include an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token that indicates when the credentials expire. For more information, see [Using temporary credentials with AWS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html) in the IAM User Guide.

Users need programmatic access if they want to interact with AWS outside of the AWS Management Console. The way to grant programmatic access depends on the type of user that's accessing AWS.

To grant users programmatic access, choose one of the following options:

| Which user needs programmatic access? | To | By |
|---------------------------------------|----|----|
| **Workforce identity (Users managed in IAM Identity Center)** | Use temporary credentials to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or AWS APIs. | Following the instructions for the interface that you want to use:<br>- For the AWS CLI, see [Configuring the AWS CLI to use AWS IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/sso-configure-profile-token.html) in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.<br>- For AWS SDKs, tools, and AWS APIs, see [IAM Identity Center authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) in the AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide. |
| **IAM**                              | Use temporary credentials to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or AWS APIs. | Following the instructions in [Using temporary credentials with AWS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html) in the IAM User Guide. |
| **IAM (Not recommended)**            | Use long-term credentials to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or AWS APIs. | Following the instructions in [Manage access keys for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) in the IAM User Guide. |

#### Step 4: Install the AWS CLI

The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

To install the AWS CLI, follow the instructions in [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

#### Step 5: Use the AWS CLI to configure AWS credentials

After you install the AWS CLI, you need to configure it with your AWS credentials. To configure the AWS CLI, follow the instructions in [Configuration and credential file settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

#### Next steps

After completing the prerequisites, you are ready to [Install the AWS SAM CLI](#install-the-aws-sam-cli).

## Hello World Tutorial

In this tutorial, you use the AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (AWS SAM CLI) to build a simple serverless application that consists of an AWS Lambda function and an Amazon API Gateway endpoint. You deploy the application to the AWS Cloud, test it, and then delete it.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, make sure that you have completed the following prerequisites:

- [AWS SAM prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Install the AWS SAM CLI](#install-the-aws-sam-cli)

### Step 1: Initialize the sample Hello World application

To initialize the sample Hello World application, use the `sam init` command.

```bash
$ sam init
```

Follow the prompts to select the following options:

- Template source: AWS Quick Start Templates
- Application template: Hello World Example
- Runtime: python3.9
- Package type: Zip

After the initialization is complete, you will have a new directory called `sam-app` that contains the application code and configuration files.

### Step 2: Build your application

To build your application, use the `sam build` command.

```bash
$ cd sam-app
$ sam build
```

This command builds the application and prepares it for deployment.

### Step 3: Deploy your application to the AWS Cloud

To deploy your application, use the `sam deploy` command with the `--guided` option.

```bash
$ sam deploy --guided
```

Follow the prompts to configure the deployment settings. When prompted, confirm the changes to initiate the deployment.

After the deployment is complete, note the API endpoint URL that is displayed in the output.

### Step 4: Run your application

To run your application, send a request to the API endpoint URL that you noted in the previous step.

You can use a tool like `curl` or a web browser to send a GET request to the endpoint.

For example:

```bash
$ curl https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/Prod/hello/
```

You should receive a response similar to the following:

```json
{"message": "hello world"}
```

### Step 5: Interact with your function in the AWS Cloud

To interact with your Lambda function in the AWS Cloud, you can use the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.

For example, to invoke the function using the AWS CLI, run the following command:

```bash
$ aws lambda invoke --function-name <function-name> output.txt
```

Replace `<function-name>` with the name of your Lambda function.

### Step 6: Modify and sync your application to the AWS Cloud

To modify your application, make changes to the code or configuration files in your local directory.

To sync your changes to the AWS Cloud, use the `sam sync` command.

```bash
$ sam sync --watch
```

This command watches for changes in your local directory and automatically deploys them to the AWS Cloud.

### Step 7: (Optional) Test your application locally

To test your application locally, use the `sam local` commands.

For example, to invoke your Lambda function locally, run:

```bash
$ sam local invoke
```

To start a local API Gateway endpoint, run:

```bash
$ sam local start-api
```

### Step 8: Delete your application from the AWS Cloud

To delete your application from the AWS Cloud, use the `sam delete` command.

```bash
$ sam delete
```

Follow the prompts to confirm the deletion.

#### Using AWS SAM CLI with Serverless.tf

The AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (AWS SAM CLI) can be used with Serverless.tf modules for local debugging and testing of your AWS Lambda functions and layers. The following AWS SAM CLI commands are supported:

- `sam build`
- `sam local invoke`
- `sam local start-api`
- `sam local start-lambda`

> **Note**
> Serverless.tf version 4.6.0 and newer supports AWS SAM CLI integration.

To begin using the AWS SAM CLI with your Serverless.tf modules, update to the latest version of Serverless.tf and the AWS SAM CLI.

Starting from Serverless.tf version 6.0.0, you must set the `create_sam_metadata` parameter as `true`. This generates the metadata resources that the AWS SAM CLI `sam build` command requires.

To learn more about Serverless.tf, see the [terraform-aws-lambda-module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws/latest).

## AWS SAM CLI Terraform support

### What is the AWS SAM CLI?

The AWS SAM CLI is a command line tool that you can use with AWS SAM templates and supported third-party integrations, such as Terraform, to build and run your serverless applications. For an introduction to the AWS SAM CLI, see [What is the AWS SAM CLI?](#what-is-the-aws-sam-cli).

The AWS SAM CLI supports the following commands for Terraform:

- `sam local invoke` - Initiate a one-time invocation of an AWS Lambda function resource locally. To learn more about this command, see [Introduction to testing with sam local invoke](#intro-to-sam-local-invoke).
- `sam local start-api` - Run your Lambda resources locally and test through a local HTTP server host. This type of testing is helpful for Lambda functions that are invoked by an API Gateway endpoint. To learn more about this command, see [Introduction to testing with sam local start-api](#intro-to-sam-local-start-api).
- `sam local start-lambda` - Start a local endpoint for your Lambda function in order to invoke your function locally using AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or SDKs. To learn more about this command, see [Introduction to testing with sam local start-lambda](#intro-to-sam-local-start-lambda).

### How do I use the AWS SAM CLI with Terraform?

The core Terraform workflow consists of three stages: Write, Plan, and Apply. With AWS SAM CLI support for Terraform, you can take advantage of the AWS SAM CLI `sam local` set of commands while continuing to use your Terraform workflows to manage your applications on AWS. Generally, this means the following:

- **Write** - Author your infrastructure as code using Terraform.
- **Test and debug** - Use the AWS SAM CLI to locally test and debug your applications.
- **Plan** - Preview changes before applying.
- **Apply** - Provision your infrastructure.

For an example of using the AWS SAM CLI with Terraform, see [Better together: AWS SAM CLI and HashiCorp Terraform](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/better-together-aws-sam-cli-and-hashicorp-terraform/) at the AWS Compute Blog.

> **Note**
> As part of the parsing step of AWS SAM CLI's integration, AWS SAM CLI processes user commands generate project files and data. The command output should remain unchanged, but in certain environments, the environment or runner may inject additional logs or information in the output.

### Next steps

To complete all prerequisites and set up Terraform, see [Getting started with Terraform support for AWS SAM CLI](#getting-started-1).

## Publishing for others to use

To make your AWS SAM application available for others to find and deploy, you can use the AWS SAM CLI to publish it to the AWS Serverless Application Repository. To publish your application using the AWS SAM CLI, you must define it using an AWS SAM template. You also must have tested it locally or in the AWS Cloud.

Follow the instructions in this topic to create a new application, create a new version of an existing application, or update the metadata of an existing application. (What you do depends on whether the application already exists in the AWS Serverless Application Repository, and whether any application metadata is changing.) For more information about application metadata, see [AWS SAM template Metadata section properties](#metadata-section-properties).

### Prerequisites

Before you publish an application to the AWS Serverless Application Repository using the AWS SAM CLI, you must have the following:

- The AWS SAM CLI installed. For more information, see [Install the AWS SAM CLI](#install-the-aws-sam-cli). To determine whether the AWS SAM CLI is installed, run the following command:
  
  ```bash
  $ sam --version
  ```

- A valid AWS SAM template.
- Your application code and dependencies that the AWS SAM template references.
- A semantic version, required only to share your application publicly. This value can be as simple as `1.0`.
- A URL that points to your application's source code.
- A `README.md` file. This file should describe how customers can use your application and how to configure it before deploying it in their own AWS accounts.
- A `LICENSE.txt` file, required only to share your application publicly.
- If your application contains any nested applications, you must have already published them to the AWS Serverless Application Repository.
- A valid Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket policy that grants the service read permissions for artifacts that you upload to Amazon S3 when you package your application. To set up this policy, do the following:

  1. Open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).
  2. Choose the name of the Amazon S3 bucket that you used to package your application.
  3. Choose **Permissions**.
  4. On the **Permissions** tab, under **Bucket policy**, choose **Edit**.
  5. On the **Edit bucket policy** page, paste the following policy statement into the **Policy editor**. In the policy statement, make sure to use your bucket name in the `Resource` element and your AWS account ID in the `Condition` element. The expression in the `Condition` element ensures that AWS Serverless Application Repository has permission to access only applications from the specified AWS account. For more information about policy statements, see [IAM JSON policy elements reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html) in the IAM User Guide.

     ```json
     {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
             {
                 "Effect": "Allow",
                 "Principal": {
                     "Service": "serverlessrepo.amazonaws.com"
                 },
                 "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                 "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name>/*",
                 "Condition": {
                     "StringEquals": {
                         "aws:SourceAccount": "123456789012"
                     }
                 }
             }
         ]
     }
     ```

  6. Choose **Save changes**.

### Publishing a new application

#### Step 1: Add a Metadata section to the AWS SAM template

First, add a `Metadata` section to your AWS SAM template. Provide the application information to be published to the AWS Serverless Application Repository.

The following is an example `Metadata` section:

```yaml
Metadata:
  AWS::ServerlessRepo::Application:
    Name: my-app
    Description: hello world
    Author: user1
    SpdxLicenseId: Apache-2.0
    LicenseUrl: LICENSE.txt
    ReadmeUrl: README.md
    Labels: ['tests']
    HomePageUrl: https://github.com/user1/my-app-project
    SemanticVersion: 0.0.1
    SourceCodeUrl: https://github.com/user1/my-app-project
Resources:
  HelloWorldFunction:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      ...
      CodeUri: source-code1
      ...
```

For more information about the `Metadata` section of the AWS SAM template, see [AWS SAM template Metadata section properties](#metadata-section-properties).

#### Step 2: Package the application

Run the following AWS SAM CLI command, which uploads the application's artifacts to Amazon S3 and outputs a new template file called `packaged.yaml`:

```bash
$ sam package --output-template-file packaged.yaml --s3-bucket <your-bucket-name>
```

You use the `packaged.yaml` template file in the next step to publish the application to the AWS Serverless Application Repository. This file is similar to the original template file (`template.yaml`), but it has a key differenceâthe `CodeUri`, `LicenseUrl`, and `ReadmeUrl` properties point to the Amazon S3 bucket and objects that contain the respective artifacts.

The following snippet from an example `packaged.yaml` template file shows the `CodeUri` property:

```yaml
MySampleFunction:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    CodeUri: s3://bucketname/fbd77a3647a4f47a352fcObjectGUID
    ...
```

#### Step 3: Publish the application

To publish a private version of your AWS SAM application to the AWS Serverless Application Repository, run the following AWS SAM CLI command:

```bash
$ sam publish --template packaged.yaml --region us-east-1
```

The output of the `sam publish` command includes a link to your application on the AWS Serverless Application Repository. You can also go directly to the AWS Serverless Application Repository landing page and search for your application.

#### Step 4: Share the application (optional)

By default, your application is set to private, so it isnât visible to other AWS accounts. To share your application with others, you must either make it public or grant permission to a specific list of AWS accounts.

For information about sharing your application using the AWS CLI, see [AWS Serverless Application Repository Resource-Based Policy Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverlessrepo/latest/devguide/serverlessrepo-how-to-share.html) in the AWS Serverless Application Repository Developer Guide. For information on sharing your application using the AWS Management Console, see [Sharing an Application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverlessrepo/latest/devguide/sharing-applications.html) in the AWS Serverless Application Repository Developer Guide.

### Publishing a new version of an existing application

After youâve published an application to the AWS Serverless Application Repository, you might want to publish a new version of it. For example, you might have changed your Lambda function code or added a new component to your application architecture.

To update an application that youâve previously published, publish the application again using the same process detailed previously. In the `Metadata` section of the AWS SAM template file, provide the same application name that you originally published it with, but include a new `SemanticVersion` value.

For example, consider an application published with the name `SampleApp` and a `SemanticVersion` of `1.0.0`. To update that application, the AWS SAM template must have the application name `SampleApp` and a `SemanticVersion` of `1.0.1` (or anything other than `1.0.0`).

### Additional topics

- [AWS SAM template Metadata section properties](#metadata-section-properties)

### Metadata section properties

`AWS::ServerlessRepo::Application` is a metadata key that you can use to specify application information that you want published to the AWS Serverless Application Repository.

> **Note**
> AWS CloudFormation intrinsic functions arenât supported by the `AWS::ServerlessRepo::Application` metadata key.

#### Properties

This table provides information about the properties of the `Metadata` section of the AWS SAM template. This section is required to publish applications to the AWS Serverless Application Repository using the AWS SAM CLI.

| Property          | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                           |
|-------------------|--------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
